# Film Database

A React/Vite application to catalog films, eg. for a DVD collection.

Users can search for films using the API provided by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

From the results, films can then be added to the *Library*. These results are then saved to localStorage.

Films can also be added to a list of *Favourites*. This list is also saved locally.
